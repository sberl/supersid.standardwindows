Release 1.2.0rc4

	Python parts updated:
		See Note.txt for details

Enhancements:

	* Added optional parameter hourly_save: This will save the
	  current buffer and the data files per station every hour.
	  The station data files are now called
	  Station_ID._date_hour0000.csv so if you restart supersid
	  in the same hour, ony the last data file will be overwrtitten.
	  Supersid_upload has been adapted to recognize these station
	  data files.

	* Added optional parameter data_path allows you to change
	  where the data is saved. Useful if you want to put data
	  on network discs, or in "the cloud" via dropbox etc.
	  Again, supersid_upload has been adapted to recognize and
	  act accordingly;

	* When you save the current buffers, it will also save the
	  data files for the stations you have configured;

	* When using leaving the program (Using Quit) it will ask
	  whether you want to save the current data;

	* Added an article by Dr. Chandrakant More et. al
	  (CTMoreSIDarticle.pdf) to the ../Doc directory as requested
	  by Deborah Scherrer
